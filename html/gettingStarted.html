%% Getting Started 
% This section serves as an introduction to the Matlab environment and
% programming language as well as to this tutorial. It describes how to 
% configure and start using Matlab, search for help, and how to perform 
% file input and output.
%
%% What is Matlab? 
% Matlab is a programming environment as well as a high level, interpreted,
% dynamically typed language, supporting functional, object oriented, and
% event driven paradigms. It is well suited for numerical computation,
% particularly computations involving matrix operations and linear algebra.
%
% Matlab has excellent support for data visualization and its concise and
% expressive syntax, as well as the plethora of predefined functions,
% results in a powerful environment excellent for rapid prototyping with
% minimal overhead. 
%
% Yet, Matlab is not just a scripting language for quick and dirty
% calculations. Recent versions have seen a dramatic increase for the
% support of large scale, highly structured code to rival C++, Java and the
% like. If you want the best of both worlds, Matlab's integrated java
% support lets you create and manipulate instances of java classes right in
% your Matlab programs. You can also call out to code written in C, C++,
% Perl, Fortran, or execute dos or unix system commands. Furthermore,
% Matlab code can be exported for use in Java, C, C++, and .Net programs,
% or as a stand alone application, mitigating its primary disadvantage
% - that it is not free. 
%
% As an interpreted language, some operations are slower than in a compiled
% language, particularly those involving loops. This too has improved in
% recent versions. In many cases, however, loops can be _vectorized_
% resulting in very quick code that invokes low level, highly optimized,
% _compiled_ functions from the Matlab library. When the most
% computationally expensive parts of your program can be written this way,
% the speed of Matlab code rivals that of compiled languages. 
% 
% Finally, with the addition of various toolkits, e.g. for Statistics,
% Bioinformatics, Optimization, or Image Processing, to name just a few,
% the Matlab environment can be extended for more specialized requirements.
%%
% Matlab(R) is a product of the The Mathworks(TM) company; for more general
% information, consult their website at <http://www.mathworks.com/>.
% 
%% Starting Matlab
% To launch Matlab double click on the Matlab icon or type *Matlab* at
% a command prompt. 
% You should get a display something like the one below
%%
% <html>
% <img src="matlab2008aStartup.png" height="600">
% </html>
%%
% You can immediately type things in to the command window
% and compute their value
1 + 1 % arithmetic
sqrt(pi) % more arithmetic
'foo' % a string
or(true, false) % a boolean value
randn(2,2) % a 2d real matrix
xs = 1:10; plot(xs, xs .^ 2, 'o-'); % a 1d plot 
%%
% We explain the built-in functions and data types in more detail below.
%%
% Typing *matlab -nojvm* starts Matlab  without the Java virtual machine, 
% significantly
% reducing memory requirements at the cost of reduced functionality. None
% of the Matlab desktop windows are available in this mode, except for the
% command window. Here is how it looks.
%%
% <<nojvm.png>>
%%
%% Variables
% We can create named memory locations to store data, called variables, very
% easily in Matlab. 
%%
myvar = 3
a   = 'hello'
f   = log10(100)
g   = 2^10 - 1
%%
% Variable names must begin with a character and can contain up to 63
% characters on most systems. 
%
% Matlab stands for "matrix laboratory", since it was originally
% designed as a front-end to various numerical linear algebra packages.
% Consequently it is easy to create vectors and matrices.
% For example,
%%
a = 1:3 % 1d vector
b = [1 2; 3 4] % 2d matrix
c = ones(2,2,2) % 3d array
%%
% We discuss matrices and vectors in
% much more detail <matrixOperations.html here>.
% 
% In Matlab, scalars are really matrices of size 1x1. The basic 'scalar'
% types are double (real), char, and logical (boolean), although a number of
% (infrequently used) integer types also exist. 
% The 'container' types are:
%  <matrixOperations.html numeric or logical arrays (matrices)>,
% <dataStructures.html#cellArrays cell arrays>,
% <dataStructures.html#structs structures>,
% and <objectOriented.html objects>.
% 
%%
% Since Matlab is a dynamically typed language, we do not predefine the
% type of data we will store in a particular variable and can overwrite
% data of one type with data of another. Notice that the variable g,
% currently holds the number 1023. We will now assign it the following
% string. 
g = 'does this really work?'
%%
% You can save all of the variables in a workspace to a file by typing
% *save filename* at the command prompt and reload them again with *load
% filename*. 
%% Workspace
% To see which variables you have defined, and what their size and type is,
% type *whos*
whos
%%
% Alternatively, you can use a convenient graphical window called the workspace
% (see below). If
% it is not already visible, you can bring it up by typing *workspace* at
% the command prompt or by going to the desktop drop down menu.  You can
% then drag and place it wherever it is convenient. 
%%
% <<workspace.png>>
%%
% You can clear all the variables using
clear all
%% Command Window
% You have already seen how to type expressions or commands
% into the command window. If you do not
% add a semicolon at the end of your commands, the return value will be
% displayed, otherwise the expression will be silently evaluated.
% For example, compare
a = ones(2,2)
%%
% to this
a = ones(2,2); % nothing is displayed  
%%
% The last typed command can be retrieved by selecting the command window
% and pressing the _up arrow key_ on your keyboard. Pressing it several
% times scrolls you backwards through the history of typed commands. By
% first typing in part of the command before pressing the up arrow, only
% those statements that began with the typed text are displayed. 
%%
% Furthermore, you can invoke Matlab's autocomplete feature by typing part
% of a command or function and pressing tab. A number of suggested options
% will appear. The same is true when editing files.
%
%% Help
% One of Matlab's best features is its extensive library of help files.
% There are far too many built in functions to memorize and even if you
% remember the name, the exact syntax might allude you. You can bring up
% the help navigator by going to Desktop -> Help or search right from the
